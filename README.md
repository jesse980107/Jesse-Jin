# [ReasearchQFinder: News Research Tool](https://github.com/jesse980107/research_tool_project)
ReasearchQFinder is a user-friendly news research tool designed for effortless information retrieval. Users can input article URLs and ask questions to receive relevant insights from any domain.
### Features

- Load URLs or upload text files containing URLs to fetch article content.
- Process article content through LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader
- Construct an embedding vector using OpenAI's embeddings and leverage FAISS, a powerful similarity search library, to enable swift and effective retrieval of relevant information
- Interact with the LLM's (Chatgpt) by inputting queries and receiving answers along with source URLs.

# [U.S. Insurance Bill Estimator](https://github.com/jesse980107/U.S.-Insurance-Bill-Estimator)
For this example I build a bill charge estimator to an insurance plan each year based on the policy holder’s demographic information. This could be useful for someone who is insurance director. They could use a customer's information to estimate their hopspital bill and help them determine which insurence plan is better for this costomer.
* Creat a tool that estimate costomer's hospital bill to help insurence director determine which insurence plan is better for their costomers
* Engineered features from BMI and ages
* Optimized Linear, Quadratic and Interaction terms added, and standardized with Backward Selection algorithm to reach the best model

# [Online Shopping Intention Analysis](https://github.com/jesse980107/online-shopping)
With the growth of online shopping, it has become important to understand the factors that influence a consumer’s intention to buy from a website rather than just browse. This emerging topic is of interest to both academics and machine learning practitioners.
From the matrix below, it is clear that we have poorly bundled many successful revenue sessions as uninterested customers, which means when the high bounce rate combined with a short product-related page duration, there are still a lot of customers. targets.

# [Kaggle competition - Predict Rossmann Store Sales](https://github.com/jesse980107/Predict-Rossmann-Store-Sales-by-Gradient-Boosting-XGBoost)
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.
* Did a lot of feature engineering
* I build a sales estimator by using GBMs with XGBoost

# [Project 1: U.S. Insurance Bill Estimator](https://github.com/jesse980107/U.S.-Insurance-Bill-Estimator)
For this example I build a bill charge estimator to an insurance plan each year based on the policy holderâ€™s demographic information. This could be useful for someone who is insurance director. They could use a customer's information to estimate their hopspital bill and help them determine which insurence plan is better for this costomer.
* Creat a tool that estimate costomer's hospital bill to help insurence director determine which insurence plan is better for their costomers
* Engineered features from BMI and ages
* Optimized Linear, Quadratic and Interaction terms added, and standardized with Backward Selection algorithm to reach the best model
